# Brainiac

Brainiac, is the Final Team Project for our group in the Google Computer Science Summer Instiutute. Our aim was to allow people to test their knowledge and destress with some games!
Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and APIs
Developed a trivia game and character guessing game through the use of APIs (opentdb, superhero-api)
Games were implemented through the use of flex grids, inputs, buttons, event listeners, functions, for loops, conditions, arrays, and query selectors.
Developed CSS for the UI and NavBar of the project
